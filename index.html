        <h2>Advantages of Washing your hands Properly</h2>
        <h4>
          Handwashing with soap removes germs from hands. This helps prevent
          infections because:
        </h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            People frequently touch their eyes, nose, and mouth without even
            realizing it. Germs can get into the body through the eyes, nose and
            mouth and make us sick.
          </li>
          <li>
            Germs from unwashed hands can get into foods and drinks while people
            prepare or consume them. Germs can multiply in some types of foods
            or drinks, under certain conditions, and make people sick.
          </li>
          <li>
            Germs from unwashed hands can be transferred to other objects, like
            handrails, table tops, or toys, and then transferred to another
            personâ€™s hands.
          </li>
          <li>
            Removing germs through handwashing therefore helps prevent diarrhea
            and respiratory infections and may even help prevent skin and eye
            infections.
          </li>
